# About Me

I'm Praneel Seth, a University of Texas at Austin computer science student. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning, in both theory and in practical applications. I like to learn new things, whether it's new tools, languages, frameworks, or explore concepts/fields of study such as computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), neural networks, transformers, reinforcement learning, AI agents, and applications in autonomous vehicles or robots. I'm interested in these fields of AI/ML and more, and I would love to work on projects related to any of these (I'm not married to a specific field).



Currently, I'm looking for internship opportunities where I get to work in an environment where I get to build and test cool things and deploy the project into production to make a tangible impact thorugh my work. I would love to work at a company or at a startup, and I'm willing to relocate anywhere in the US for the opportunity. The most important thing for me in an internship position is the role- I want to work on something related to AI/ML.



I'm the vice president of the corporate team of the Texas Association for Computing Machiner, or Texas ACM. There's more info on Texas ACM at the website texasacm.org. For fun, I play basketball with friends and I'm on a fusion bollywood dance team called Texas Dhoom.



My technical skills include languages such as Java, Python, C#, C++, C, Javascript, Swift, and PostGRE SQL. I've work with frameworks/tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, React, Node.js, Flask, Streamlit, Xcode, MATLAB/Simulink. I've worked in software development methodologies such as AGILE, and two week sprints through my paycom internship experience.



Some of my specific technical interests include building an AI agent to automate decision making, implementing a chatbot or other AI tool in a full stack context for a client-facing service, using reinforcement learning or deep learning to program drones, cars, or robots to achieve certain goals. I would be most interested in doing some kind of machine learning project with drones, cars, robots or with data that makes a difference in the world. An AI agent would be cool because it's the latest technology and it makes people's lives easier. Implementing AI in a full stack project would be awesome because it's directly using AI to make an impact for the client. And then I'd love to use machine learning to program something and make it do something cool such as programming a drone to water a farm or programming robots to do tasks that humans can't do because it's exciting to me. I'm driven by the impact that I can use these unique technologies to make in the real world. I see the possibilities when I get to be hands on with projects like these.



Why should I be hired? I should be hired because I'm a leader, I love to learn, and I love to communicate. I lead through example and I lead through service- I believe strongly in getting everyone on a team involved, using each individual's strengths to make the whole greater than its parts. I love to learn new things- I spend hours every week watching youtube videos or reading papers on the latest technologies and methods coming out. Learning is an important thing I'm looking to do in a role- it's what makes the role exciting. I love to communicate- that includes writing technical reports from a developer and from a business case perspective, presenting technical content to technical/non-technical audiences, and things like communicating when I'm stuck, and need help or clarification. I don't shy away from roadblocks- I take them as an opportunity to learn and grow my knowledge.



In company culture, I'm looking to meet people that do cool things and learn about the different things happening at the company. A focus on innovation is also important to me.
